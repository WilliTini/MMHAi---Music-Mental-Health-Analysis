# Music & Mental Health AI

This project explores the correlation between music listening habits and mental health indicators (such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and OCD) using the [MXMH Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results).  
It integrates exploratory data analysis, supervised learning, and symbolic reasoning to identify meaningful patterns and build interpretable models.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze patterns in music preferences and mental health scores
- Train ML models to predict psychological well-being based on music habits
- Build a symbolic knowledge base to reason about mental health risk based on user profiles
- Compare machine learning predictions with rule-based reasoning

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, Owlready2)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Knowledge representation via OWL and rule-based reasoning
- MXMH Survey Dataset from Kaggle

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `data/`: Original and cleaned versions of the dataset  
- `notebooks/`: EDA, ML models, and reasoning experiments  
- `kb/`: Ontologies, rules, and reasoning modules
